## 💡 About This Project

This portfolio was designed to reflect my personal style and professional ambitions.  
The main goal is to offer visitors a clean and smooth experience while navigating through my work.

An interesting detail: the cartoon avatar featured on this page was created by my dear teacher and talented artist **Letícia**, as a parting gift when I completed the "Digital Game Programming" course.  
The background, inspired by *Miles Morales*, is a personal reference, since friends often said I reminded them of the character — and as a fan, I even have Spider-Man cosplays (Peter Parker and Miles) in my collection.
